This repository contains the source code for the Late-Breaking Work presented at CHI'24, titled "Mitigating Ageism through Virtual Reality: Intergenerational Collaborative Escape Room Design". The [video](https://youtu.be/st_k5bL4ePw) illustrates the escape room's design - a multiplayer experience developed using the Mirror package on the Unity platform.

### Environment

- **Unity version**: 2020.3.19f1 with Windows and Android support
- **Target platform**: Oculus Quest 2

### Notes

- The project is designed to run on a Local Area Network (LAN), with the computer acting as the server. Therefore, you must input your computer's IP address in the "Network Address" field before deploying the program to your VR device. Additionally, ensure you start your server from Unity by clicking the run button before launching the game in VR.
- You can monitor the game progress through the first player's view on Unity platform. However, all animators are not going to be played on server due to performance optimization.
